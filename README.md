# graphdb-with-langchain

🚀 Building a Smart Q&A System with Neo4j(Graph-db) and LangChain

Integrated Neo4j with LangChain to create a dynamic Q&A system powered by the ChatGroq LLM (Gemma2-9b-It). The system uses LangChain’s GraphCypherQAChain to convert natural language queries into Cypher queries and retrieve insights from a graph database.

The project included:
1️⃣ Loading movie data into Neo4j and defining relationships.
2️⃣ Connecting Neo4j using langchain-neo4j for seamless integration.
3️⃣ Leveraging ChatGroq LLM for natural language understanding.
4️⃣ Executing queries.

This integration showcases the potential of combining graph databases with LLMs for intelligent, data-driven solutions. Excited to explore more in AI!
